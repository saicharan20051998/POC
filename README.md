## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate automated testing using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber with Java. It includes:

- **Amazon Test Cases**: Automates the process of searching for a product, adding it to the cart, and validating if the product is successfully added.
- **demo.Applitools Test Cases**: Automates the navigation to the application and calculates the sum of all transaction amounts.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Selenium WebDriver 4**: For browser automation.
- **Cucumber**: For Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and defining test scenarios.
- **Extent Reports**: For generating detailed test reports.
- **Log4j**: For logging test execution and results.
- **TestNG**: For managing test execution and providing additional functionality like parallel test execution.
- **Parallel Execution**: Leveraging TestNG's parallel execution capabilities to speed up test runs by executing multiple tests simultaneously.
- **Shutterbug**: For capturing and managing full-page screenshots to enhance test visibility.
- **AShot**: Another tool used to capture full-page screenshots to ensure comprehensive coverage of the web pages.
- **Selenium 4 Full-Page Screenshot**: Utilized for capturing complete screenshots of web pages, specifically in Firefox, to ensure accurate visual validation.
